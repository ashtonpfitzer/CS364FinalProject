            <p>Hometown: Rocklin, California</p>
            <p>Major: Computer Science</p>
            <p>Activities: Soaring Instructor Pilot</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I was born and raised in Rocklin, California. I used to play football for ten years and stopped playing after my Senior year in High School. I used to be acclimated to the heat, as it gets up to 120 degrees in California over the summer. I have also never been used to the cold because it doesn't get below 40 degrees back home. So now I am not used to the cold or the heat here or back home.</p>
            <p>I came to this school because I wanted to be a Pilot in the Air Force. That's not necessarily the dream anymore, and now I just want a job that will make me the most money. My plan, and hope, is to become a Cyber Officer in the Air Force then leave the Air Force after five years then attempt to have a reserve squadron send me through UPT, so I can become a Pilot while also making money in the civilian world as something related to Cyber.</p>
            <p>I enjoy long walks on the beach. I enjoy off-roading on trails with my Dad's jeep. I have a twin brother, who is currently living at home living the dream without a job. My family has two go-karts, so I enjoy going with my family to the track and racing them. I'm also a big 49ers fan. Although this year hasn't gone well for the 49ers, I'm still looking foward to next year and hopefully going to go to another game.</p>
            <p>I don't enjoy coding anymore but like understanding the background of how computers work and how programs work. That's why I'd like to lean more towards a cyber focus. I love hanging out with my friends and going to the gym, as well as teaching and inspiring other cadets through flying the gliders at the 94th FTS.</p>

<!--Doc Statement: I asked ChatGPT why my Personal Information header was not centering after I use text-align, so it told me to use display: block; and also told me about flex for display. I also used the CSS/HTML Explorer in LiveWeave to explore the options on how I can edit my formatting, etc.. Used the following links on examples for how to make zebra striped tables: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_table_zebra.asp , https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp . I created my HTML/CSS in liveweave.-->
